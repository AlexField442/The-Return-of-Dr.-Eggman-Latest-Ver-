LYRICS:
Yane no ue de sora wo aogu, hizashi wa uraraka.
Miageru sora karadajuu genki ga minagitteku!

THAT'S SO WONDERFUL! Ikiterunda!
Yamerarenai, akirameru da nante!

Tohou ni kureta kinou ni sayonara.
Futsufutsu to wakiagaru kono kimochi!
Nando demo yomigaeru hana wo sakaseyou!
Omoide wa itsumo amai nigebasho,
Dakedo tachikire, asu wo ikiru tame.
Shukufuku no toki wa kuru, te wo nobashite.

Uruwashi no yawarakana hada, imada te wa todokazu
Me wo tojireba fukuramu IMAGE, miwaku no kajitsu

THAT'S SO WONDERFUL! Ikiterunda!
Yamerarenai, sono saki wo mitai!

Dotou no hibi wa tsuzuku, doko made mo,
Tengoku to jigoku yukitsumodoritsu.
Nando demo yomigaeru hana wo sakaseyou!
Hashire hashire ai wo te ni suru made.
Sorede kurushimu nara nozomu tokoro.
Shukufuku no toki wa kuru, te wo nobashite.

Tohou ni kureta kinou ni sayonara.
Futsfutsu to wakiagaru kono kimochi!
Nando demo yomigaeru hana wo sakaseyou!
Omoide wa itsumo amai nigebasho,
Dakedo tachikire, asu wo ikiru tame.
Shukufuku no toki wa kuru, te wo nobashite.

Te wo nobashite!

Ryoute agete!

Yep, we're back here again, this time because of Sonic Omens; if you have been living under a rock
for the past year, Sonic Omens is a fan game developed by Russian group Ouroboros, which recently
just had its final episodes released to... less than stellar reception. However, that isn't what
I want to talk about.

What I AM talking about is a rather damning Google Doc that just got released here, explaining
all the drama that had gone on behind the scenes. Here it is here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mXC2FHMieDdt3giLxmPNz92-Ghips1EOCwsB1LRGudc/edit

Or here incase it gets taken down:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1M5q_MQbUFcZzE6RN4O5hkAEV4Bt04-/edit

For those who don't want to read it all, I'll also be posting it in bullet point form:
 * Used Patreon, VK, and ads to fund the game.
 * Also funded a previous 'How to Train Your Dragon' fan game.
 * Attacked and attempted to silence people for criticising their game.
 * Ripped off a song from 'Cars 2: The Video Game'.
 * Made (the game's) Eggman's voice actor suffer a break down on stream.
 * And texture Maria's (a 12-year-old) panties with the text "Bad Girl" written on it.

Don't play this game, play an actual good fan game like After the Sequel DX, Triple Trouble 16-bit
and Falling Star, or if you want something less well-known, Axiom and Eggman Hates Furries.
